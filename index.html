            <h3>Our Project</h3>
            <p>
                The Connected Home Project is focused on leveraging Internet-of-Things concepts to enable electrical 
                utilities to better manage the electrical load on the power grid. It is a part of Dakota State University's 
                Madison Cyber Labs research facility.
            </p>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                <!-- project description -->
                Electrical power manufacturers must maintain the infrastructure required to meet peak demands all the time; their 
                resources cannot grow and shrink with the demands on the grid. Accordingly, they must charge the utilities that 
                buy from them (and subsequently deliver power to residential areas) based on peak demand rather than total usage.
                This would be fine if power usage was constant, but consumer habits are cyclical and the load on the grid fluctutaes.
                More power is inevitably used during the day than at night. Utilities want to keep their maximum load as low as possible,
                and to do this have employed technology that can control some energy-storing devices such as water heaters. By realizing that
                applicances such as these do not need to run constantly, utilities can manage the load on the grid during peak times and
                save themselves, and the consumer, money.
                <br><br>
                There is a system in place that allows for this management alread, but it is outdated. It works by encoding commands
                as electrical pulses and sending them out on the grid. Simplistic receiver boxes in residential homes interpret these pulses
                and react accordingly. This is robust and requires very little additional infrastructure, but is slow, unwieldy, and offers no
                specific feedback. We are modernizing this system.
                <br><br>
                Current IoT technology is consumer focused; it strives to add convenience to everyday life with services like voice control
                and smart scheduling. It does not provide any real benefit outside of the consumer lifestyle though. Our goal is to use the
                same priciples found in IoT devices to expose control over home applciances to electrical utilities to allow them to better
                manage power usage throughtout the day. This will save power and money.
